For loop

-for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
-With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.
eg. fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
    for x in fruits:
    print(x)
-The for loop does not require an indexing variable to set beforehand.
